# Flask-MissiontoMars

Four websites were scraped for various text, tables and images.

A python script created to scrape and then add this information to a MongoDB.

A second python file utilizes flask to have a homepage and then a button to pull new scrape data.

An HTML and style file are created to build the content of the webpage.
